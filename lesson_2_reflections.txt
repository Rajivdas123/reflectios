What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  -On initializing a repository a new directory named .git added to the main directory.
  -we need to do that because it's this new file that sotres the metadata about the history 
   of the different versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  -working directory contains all the files that we have.But staging area contains only those files that we want to 
   commit that is make changes to.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  -In staging are you can add the files you want to change one by one, then when you commit all the files in the staging
   area form the commit.In this way you have one commit per logical change
