How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    we can see if the bug is because of something we have added to or removed from the 
    old file.	  

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Then it will be easy for us to see the gradual development of a code and how different
    types of changes affect the consequences.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    choosing save commits manually ensure that the change is logical and it means something
    which is important. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    when changing one file affect some other file we need to save all related files 
    in oe commit as in git.But if it's not there is no reason to save them together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    with git log command we can see the commit history with the most recent commits at the 
    top. With git diff command we can see the differnce between two commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because if it breaks somethig we have many working checkpoints that we can move back.
    And find exactly at which commit breakdown starts.Then i can find the bug by comparing 
    this commit with just the previous commit.Then fix the bug.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try to make my own repository and apply all those commands that i have learned
    till now.
